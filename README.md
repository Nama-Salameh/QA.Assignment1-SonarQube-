# Programming Errors

## 1.Data Reference Errors :

## 2.Computation Errors :

## 3.Control-Flow Errors :
 <p>1. error(181,8) && error(283,9) Conditional expressions are always tru : 
 Conditional expressions which are always true or false can lead to dead code.It is lead to major impairments of system dependability during component interactions .</p>
 

## 4.Input/Output Errors :
<p>1. error(199,16) Incorrect exception handling: Using generic exceptions prevents calling methods from handling true, system-generated exceptions differently than application-generated errors.so It is lead to major impairments of system Testability.</p>
<p>2. error(42) copy,posts,cut,move should be static final : Public class variable fields do not respect the encapsulation principle and has main disadvantage ,Member values are subject to change from anywhere in the code and may not meet the programmerâ€™s assumptions. so It is lead to major impairments of system Reliability.
<p>3. error(42) Multiple variables should not be declared on the same line: Declaring multiple variables on one line is difficult to read.so It is lead to reduces system readability.
