# Programming Errors

## 1.Data Reference Errors :

## 2.Computation Errors :

## 3.Control-Flow Errors :
 <p>1. error(181,8) && error(283,9) Conditional expressions are always tru : 
 Conditional expressions which are always true or false can lead to dead code.It is lead to major impairments of system dependability during component interactions .</p>
 <p>2. error(126,2) block of comminted-out line of code should be removed: Programmers should not comment out code as it bloats programs and reduces readability.</p>
 

## 4.Input/Output Errors :
<p>1. error(199,16) Incorrect exception handling: Using generic exceptions prevents calling methods from handling true, system-generated exceptions differently than application-generated errors.so It is lead to major impairments of system Testability.</p>
<p>2. error(42) copy,posts,cut,move should be static final : Public class variable fields do not respect the encapsulation principle and has main disadvantage ,Member values are subject to change from anywhere in the code and may not meet the programmerâ€™s assumptions. so It is lead to major impairments of system Reliability.
<p>3. error(42) Multiple variables should not be declared on the same line: Declaring multiple variables on one line is difficult to read.so It is lead to reduces system readability.
 <p>4. error(166,5) && error(196,4) replace system.out by logger :If a program directly writes to the standard outputs, there is absolutely no way to comply with those requirements. so It is lead to reduces system Testability.</p>
 <p>5. error(228,60) declare constant inested of String duplicated: Duplicated string literals make the process of refactoring error-prone, since you must be sure to update all occurrences.so It is lead to reduces system dependability.
